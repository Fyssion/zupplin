# Contributing to Zupplin

Thank you for taking the time to contribute and help out.
While this is a toy project, I still appreciate all contributions.

The following are guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Good Bug Reports

Please be aware of the following things when filing bug reports.

1. Don't open duplicate issues. Please search for your issue to see if it has been asked already. Duplicate issues will be closed.
2. Make sure to provide enough information to make the issue actionable. The issue form will generally walk you through the process, but they are listed here as well:
    - A **summary** of your bug report. This is generally a quick sentence or two to describe the issue.
    - Guidance on **how to reproduce the issue**.
    - If applicable, include **relevant screenshots/videos** that help explain your issue.
    - Tell us **information about your environment**. What browser are you using? Does this issue appear on other browsers?

If the bug report is missing this information, it'll take longer to fix the issue.
We will probably ask for clarification, and if no response is given, then the issue will be closed.

## Submitting a Pull Request

### License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [AGPLv3 License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/) that covers the project.

### Code Style

Code style guides are found in each codebases' README.

### Testing

Please test your changes before submitting them.
Installation instructions are found in each codebases' README.

### Git Commit Guidelines

- Use present tense (e.g. "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Limit all lines to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues or pull requests outside of the first line.
  - Please use the shorthand `#123` and not the full URL.

If you do not meet any of these guidelines, don't fret.
Chances are they will be fixed upon rebasing, but please do try to meet them to remove some of the workload.
